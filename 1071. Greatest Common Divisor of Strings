Approach:
1. Check if the concatenations of str1 and str2 in different orders are the same. If not, return "".
2. Get the GCD gcdLength of the two lengths of str1 and str2.
3. Return the prefix string with a length of gcdLength of either str1 or str2 as the answer.

Solution in javascript:
function gcd(a, b){
    if(b == 0)
        return a;
    else
        return gcd(b, a%b);
}
var gcdOfStrings = function(str1, str2) {
    let n = str1.length;
    let m = str2.length;
    return str1+str2 == str2+str1 ? str1.slice(0, gcd(n,m)) : ""
};
Time complexity: O(m+n)
    - We need to compare the two concatenations of length O(m+n), it takes O(m+n) time.
    - We calculate the GCD using binary Euclidean algorithm, it takes log⁡(m⋅n) time.
    - To sum up, the overall time complexity is O(m+n).
Space complexity: O(m+n)
    - We need to compare the two concatenations of length O(m+n).
