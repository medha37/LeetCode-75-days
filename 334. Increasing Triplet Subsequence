https://leetcode.com/problems/increasing-triplet-subsequence/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=leetcode-75

Approach:
1. Itrate the loop over given set of integer.
2. Store the smallest element in first varible.
3. Store the sec min element which is greater than the first element.
4. At the 3rd iteration if the value of element is greater than both first and sec simply return true as we found 
   the desired triplet.

Sol: 
var increasingTriplet = function(nums) {
    let n = nums.length;
    let first = Infinity;
    let sec = Infinity;

    for(let i=0; i<n; i++){
        if(nums[i] <= first){
            first = nums[i];
        } else if(nums[i] <= sec){
            sec = nums[i];
        } else {
            return true;
        }
    }
    return false;
    
};
